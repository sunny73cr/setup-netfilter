# setup-netfilter
A collection of shell scripts that build a config file for use with NetFilter.
This should assist (or completely automate) the setup of NetFIlter in Linux-based clients and servers.

TODO:
- (Underway) Plenty.

- Extend the 'match-building' scripts to perform some basic 'deep' packet inspection

- Write the client/server ruleset config builder.
- Note: this requires some os-dependent utility scripts for detecting some system configuration.
	- Areas include interface names and network topology, such as:
	- Routes/ Default Gateway
	- Assigned netblock
	- DNS Server addresses / ports
	- DHCP Server addresses / ports
	- NTP Server addresses / ports
	- Rudimentary (in-rule) access control lists for the above services

- Automate managment of sets containing netblocks announced by specific Autonomous System Numbers
- Consider rule management / is it possible to use comments / some library to identify rules and delete/update them.
