  remove ramble regarding root dispersion; that is for stratum 2 + only

 try_match_ntp_stratum_1
  remove convert_ascii_to_decimal
  reference_timestamp_leniency should be milliseconds? maybe microseconds
  stratum should be one...
  root dispersion fraction... check again

  remove convert_ascii_to_decimal
  root dispersion fraction... check again
