# setup-netfilter
A collection of shell scripts that build a config file for use with NetFilter.
This should assist (or completely automate) the setup of NetFilter in Linux-based client and servers.

TODO:
- (Underway) Plenty
- (Underway) Seperate functions into re-usable utilities
- (Complete?) Fix issues where empty arguments break utility functions
- Extend the client ruleset somewhat
- Begin to write the router/server ruleset/s

Next release slated for 30th September 2024 (likely midday NZDT).
Massive overhaul including many bug fixes; improved usability; 'fault-tolerant code'; better debug output.
The next release will not introduce any 'new' features; but rather, will completely implement each 'feature' that was present
in the initial upload. I'm hoping the release will be bug free; though there may be some small issues to iron out in terms of debug output and user input.
