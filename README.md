# setup-netfilter
A collection of shell scripts that build a config file for use with NetFilter.
This should assist (or completely automate) the setup of NetFilter in Linux-based client and servers.

TODO:
- (Underway) Seperate functions into re-usable utilities
- Extend the client ruleset somewhat
- Begin to write the router/server ruleset/s
- Automate management of sets containing netblocks announced by ASNs
